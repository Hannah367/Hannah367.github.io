      <div class="col-md-5 text-center text">Now I am in my third year at university we are tasked with creating an individual project throughout the whole year. This process started in the final term of second year where we had a short module outlining the different project types and what we would need to do in order to match the different marking criteria. I did some initial brainstorming and research after hearing about these different types and then chose three top ideas which I thought could work best. </div>

      <div class="col-md-4 text">After these brainstorms, I did some further research over the summer and decided on which idea I thought I could do the most with. I decided on my Safety App design project as I really liked the concept and after deciding a career in UX Design is something that I was most interested in, thought this project would demonstrate my skills best. I then began to develop some sketches about what I thought the app could look like, as well as taking my initial user research and creating some early user personas. </div>

      <div class="col-md-6 text">During the first two terms of final year, I have been mainly focusing on the user research portion of the project, as this is key to the development of my app. As this project has a longer time scale than others I have completed, I have been able to carry out much more effective and in depth user research than before. I started off by sending out some generic Google Form surveys to grasp an idea of what my target audience thought of relating topics. I then took these to develop an app feature list as well as initial user journey maps and wireframes. I then moved onto asking about branding and colours, as these are just as important when creating a new app, and could then take this information into creating my first coloured prototype in Adobe XD. Once I had finished this first draft, I completed some user testing where I designed a list of scenarios and then observed my users as they used the app to work through the situations. This user testing was very beneficial to the project as I was able to observe interactions with my prototype and also ask users for feedback on the usabiltiy. After completing several different rounds of testing, in different situations such as day vs night, I was able to make the final edits to my app. </div>
