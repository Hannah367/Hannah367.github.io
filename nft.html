      <h2 class="col-md-7">Overview</h2>
      <div class="col-md-7 text-center text">In order to enhance my design skills outside of my university studies I decided to create my own collection of unique NFTs, drawing them all myself and creating individual stories for each one. I really enjoyed the process of coming up with an NFT concept from scratch and then going on to design 50 unique characters using design tools on my iPad.</div>

      <div class="col-md-4"><img class="myImages" src="resources/ppdescription.png" alt="An image of the descriptions I made for my individual Party Puses."></div>
      <div class="col-md-4 text">After completing the designing and drawing of the different PartyPuses, I then decided that to make my project stand out I would create a unique short story to go with each. I looked at the designs that I had come up with for each Octopus and then used my imagination to think of different ways that they could have ended up looking the way they did. Then I connected these drawings and their stories and came up with a unique name for each one.</div>

      <h2 class="col-md-7">Social Media Promotion</h2>
      <div class="col-md-7 text">I also created social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram to promote them. Here I was able to learn about the current social media market and how people enjoy to view their content the most. I created a variety of different posts, from announcements to sneak peaks and even some video content and recieved some likes and shares for my posts. Although I didn't end up selling any of these due to the crash in crypto-currency, the overall experience taught me a lot about design and the forever changing technical and design industries. I did a lot of research into other NFTs and what was popular and selling, which is what led me to choose a fun animal for the basis of my product. I enjoyed looking into trends and user patterns as much as I could to try and establish a basis for my project that would make them as popular as possible. </div>
