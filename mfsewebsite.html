      <div class="col-md-12 text-center text">After University I took on a role at a sports and childcare company, helping with that side of the business as well as helping them improve the technical aspects of the business. The first step of this was to create them a new website, which contained the information they had on their current one as well as new information that would be more helpful to the customer.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="row css-allign">
      <div class="col-md-8 text">This was a great opportunity to build on the knowledge that I gained in University and apply them to a client based situation. To start this I needed to understand the needs of my client and get an overview of what they expected from the project. After I had recieved this brief I started creating some sketches of the new website so that I could create an overview of the project. I then went back to the client with the sketches and checked that it matched up with their vision and the brief that we created together. The client also discussed developing this project to include their own booking system, which I have begun some designing in Figma<a href="bookingsystem.html"> which you can click here to view</a>.</div>

      <div class="col-md-6 text">After this discussion it was time to start executing the vision. I started by creating a basic website using just HTML and CSS so that I could achieve the correct asthetic and then after this intial version was finished, I took it back to the client and again compared it with their vision and the brief to ensure I was still on track. From working so closely with a client on a project, I learnt how important it is to ensure you catch up with them during each stage of your process, or if this isn't possible, keep referring to the brief. Using JavaScript I then built on this basic version to create the menu, staff and shop pages using json files to load in the data, therefore making them easier to edit and update. I built on the CSS and introduced some of the Bootstrap framework to improve the overall look of the page. While the project is live at <a href="mfse.org.uk">mfse.org.uk</a>, it is a continuing project which I will add to as the company develops.</div>
