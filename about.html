          <div class="col-md-8 text-center text">Hello, my name is Hannah Stutely and I am currently a third year student at the University of York, studying Interactive Media. I have thorougly enjoyed the world of computers and design from a young age, creating all sorts of projects from Holiday Video Vlogs to making movies in my room to my more proffesional projects since being at university. I have created this website in order to showcase a variety of the projects I have completed throughout my life but also to tell you a bit about myself outside of my studies.</div>

          <div class="col-6 col-md-4 text">Outside of my studies I have a keen interest in cricket, being the Vice President of the university women's cricket club. I was an active participant in the club last year being part of the team that won the East Yorkshire Women's Indoor League and was very keen to be part of the commitee this year. To gain my role I had to create a short and fun video explaining why people should vote for me which allowed me to put some of the skills I have learnt at university to the test.</div>

          <div class="col-6"><img src="resources/cooperate.png" alt="An image of some of my designs in Adobe XD"></div>
          <div class="col-6 text">I have created a section on this website to showcase some of my favourite projects. I have chosen projects which range from some of the earliest work I did to the latest piece of work which is ongoing. I have always enjoyed using softwares such as Adobe Premier Pro to create home videos like to Holiday Videos featured in the projects section. I had some basic coding experience before univeristy but have really learnt to expand this using languages such as C# and JavaScript heavily during my course. I have most thorougkly enjoyed the design aspects that come with coding especially when creating websites and prototypes (also shown within my projects section). </div>
