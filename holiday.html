      <div class="col-md-6 text-center text">Some of the first work I did in the space of Interactive Media is based around making slideshows and vlog style videos from a selection of family holidays. I used a variety of video editing softwares to make these with transitions, captions and music. They were also some of the first design work that I thought about as I wanted to use appropraite text and colours to match the theme of the videos. Below are some short clips of the designs I used during these types of videos.</div>
      <div class="col-md-6 img-grid-container text">My main project like this was a vlog style video that I created when we went to Disney World. While we were there I filmed a variety of different clips each day and then when we were home I put them all into the video software to create one long film. I then looked at the clips individually, adding text comments along with fun effects and music to create a finalised film.</div>
