          <div class="col-md-8 text-center text">During my User Experience Design module, our first task was a group project with the brief being that we must design a new innovative way for remote learning to take place. This was our first experience of combining all of the design process skills we had learnt to create a high fidelity prototype in Adobe XD. This process started with our initial personas and a survey that we sent out to students and teachers as they were the most relevant people for the chosen brief. After collecting this data we analysed the trends and used this to create affinity maps which made looking at the trends easier. This then allowed us to inform our initial sketches and personas.  </div>

          <div class="col-6 col-md-4"><img src="resources/advancedwireframes.png" alt="An image of some advanced wireframes also used within the design process."></div>
          <div class="col-md-8 text">I was responsible for creating initial designs for our team logo along with a lot of the wireframing and turning these into the final prototype. After we had done our first sketches, we turned them into these wireframes and then began the process of turning these into the final prototype. We then had to look at the colours we wanted to use to ensure we maintained a proffesional looking outcome, while making sure it was bold and eye-catching. We thought that the dark teal and blue colours acheived this combination perfectly. </div>

        <div class="row css-row-gap2">
          <div class="col-md-6 text">I then used Adobe XD in order to create the screens that would be accompanying the train. I experimented with different colours and fonts, which I decided on after doing consumer research around the options. I drew out lots of sketches surrounding what the screens would look like and planned user journey maps that helped me to plan how they would interact with the system I created.</div>
