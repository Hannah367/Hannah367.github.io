      <div class="col-md-7 text">In my current role as a Technical Advisor at MFSE I am responsible for a variety of the digital products associated with the company. Having built them a new website, I was then asked to desgin and booking system and app that would assist parents in viewing and booking our different services. This was a breif I was very excited by as my managers were unsure of how they wanted these to look and I was confident that I could put my UX knowledge to the test and design two pieces which would look proffessional and could be later developed into working products.</div>

      <h2 class="col-md-7">Prototyping In Figma</h2>
      <div class="col-md-7 text">After working a lot in Adobe XD at university I was keen to delve into Figma as I was aware this is a more widely used tool. I felt a lot of the skills I learnt in XD were transferable to Figma and I was quickly able to pick up on any elements that varied. If found the possibilites with Figma were mich wider espeically when it came to developing transitions between pages, and I could create more realistic and robust prototypes to fit my briefs.</div>
